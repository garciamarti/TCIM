Empirical Estimates of the Marginal Cost of Health Produced by a Healthcare System: Methodological Considerations from Country-Level Estimates,"Edney, L. C.",2022,"The authors propose an empirical estimation method to estimate the marginal cost per unit of health produced by a healthcare system, which involves two parts: (1) modelling population-level health outcomes against health spending and other control variables to estimate the health spending elasticity, and (2) modelling to extrapolate the estimated effect to impact on a lifetime generic measure of health such as QALYs or DALYs. This approach accounts for key methodological considerations including measurement of key variables, controlling for endogeneity using panel data or instrumental variables, inclusion of lagged spending, discounting future costs and benefits, use of analytical weights, level of disease aggregation, and modelling mortality and morbidity effects of health spending.

The framework categorizes DHTs into three broad functional categories based on risk and function, and emphasizes budget impact analysis for economic evaluation. Using the following development approach: The authors developed the value assessment framework for digital health technologies by outlining a conceptual model and associated methods that guide assessments of DHTs, setting evidence standards based on functional categories and risk tiers, and integrating domains such as clinical impact, economic impact, user experience, health equity, privacy, and data security. The framework was developed in conjunction by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) and the Peterson Health Technology Institute (PHTI), incorporating input from regulatory and HTA bodies, payers, and stakeholders, and aligning with existing ICER value assessment frameworks. to address the following objective: The framework seeks to accomplish two goals: to set evidence standards that guide technology developers to generate robust evidence on their products; and to provide reviews that help organizations adopt high-impact digital health technologies with the strongest evidence for delivering improved clinical outcomes and cost savings.","The method is moderately suitable for TCIM because some of its concepts and tools can be adapted to contexts with limited and heterogeneous evidence, although it still assumes data structures or decision environments that are not always present in traditional medicine.",Stakeholder collaboration frameworks,HTA Process Improvements,2,3,3,2,3,2.6,High,0.038992654
